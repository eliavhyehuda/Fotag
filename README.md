Users can view the images they insert in two modes. The grid layout, which arranges the photos in a grid format or list layout, which arranges the photos one after another, along with the metadata for each photo. To switch between the layout modes, users can click a button found in a toolbar that is fixed to the top. The application is responsive to the userâ€™s display.
The application renders differently on smaller displays/screens/windows then on larger displays/screens/windows, which are handled by the CSS designed for the different sizes.
Users can rate each image by selecting the number of stars to assign to that image. They are also able to filter images with a minimum rating by clicking on the search filter on the top right of the screen, in the toolbar.
Clicking on the image will enlarge it to full screen and clicking again will return the image to the default size.
